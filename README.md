 Your objective is to create an application shell that behaves like the video below - You should write all the components yourself and not use any 3rd party UI library (like bootstrap, mui or others).

Some notes on the application:
    - It must be a single page application built around ReactJS.
    - The main application has a main navigation that can be expanded / collapsed on hover.
    - Clicking on the + icon will expand a menu of options allowing to create new objects (Bug, Epic…) and navigate to a new page.
    - The main nav also contains some landing pages that can be clicked - for this implementation, having the bugs and epics landing pages is fine.
    - Clicking on the landing pages should update the browser url and should update the UI without navigating top (e.g SPA architecture)
    - Should support Chrome, Firefox and Safari
    - Staying as close as possible from the design and video is important.
    - For the icons and images, you can use any of your choice - it does not have to match exactly the video and design.
    - Should try to make it as WCAG 2.1 compliant as much as possible including support for keyboard.
    - The focus of this assessment is on the main nav and the interaction – the content of the pages is not important.
